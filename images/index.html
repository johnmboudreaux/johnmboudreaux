												</header>
												<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> React, React-Router, Redux, Redux-Thunk, JavaScript, CSS3, SCSS, ESLint, Webpack, Prop-Types, Node, Express, Enzyme, Jest and Amazon Affiliate Access (AWS).<br>
												   <strong>Get Yours</strong> was my module 3 capstone project. It is an Amazon Affiliate app (AWS) on which I recommend products and get
												   paid a percentage if a user makes a purchase through my links. I had to pitch the idea, build the app and in the end present it for a passing grade.</p>

													<h3>Weatherly</h3>
												</header>
												<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> React, JavaScript, JQuery, JSX, CSS3, Webpack, ESLint, Jest, Mocha, Chai, Enzyme and Node.<br>
												   <strong>Weatherly</strong> was my favorite app to build while at Turing because we were finally getting into React, which was very exciting.
												   It also gave me my first exposure to making api calls to a database which I thought was amazing! We also incorporated a large set of data that was an autofill feature when searching for towns or cities by name or zip.</p>

													<h3>BYOB</h3>
												</header>
												<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> JavaScript, JQuery, ESLint, Webpack, Express, Node, Knex, PostgreSQL, JsonWebToken, Chia and Mocha.<br>
												   <strong>BYOB</strong> (build your own backend) was all about the server and the database. I learned how to create json web tokens and check
												   authorization with them, how to create a database and link it to my project with Knex then request the info from the database
												   to manipulate and display it on the DOM.</p>

													<h3>Movie Tracker</h3>
												</header>
												<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> React, JavaScript, CSS3, SCSS, ESLint, Webpack, Express, Node, Prop-Types, Enzyme and Jest.<br>
												   <strong>Movie Tracker</strong> can be used to see what films are in theaters. This was my intro to giving user the ability to create a profile for an application.
												   The user is able to sign up and log in with credentials and once logged in be able to favorite movies and have them persist after log out.</p>

													<h3>Brick City/Game-Time</h3>
												</header>
												<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> OOP, JavaScript, CSS3, Webpack, CSS Loader, Mocha and Chai.<br>
												   <strong>Brick City/Game Time</strong> was my intro into Object Oriented Programming and was a crash course in HTML Canvas. The biggest challenge my
												   partner and I faced with this project was the collision detection. Keeping track of the location of all components on
												   the page at the same time was pretty tricky.</p>

													<h3>SWAPI Box</h3>
												</header>
												<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> React, React-Router, JavaScript, CSS3, SCSS, ESLint, Webpack, Prop-Types, Enzyme and Fetch-Mock.<br>
												   <strong>SWAPI Box</strong> or Star Wars API was a tough one. We were given 72 to complete this project. The idea was can we be given a project
												   with some tricky api calls, including nested ones, and turn it around within an un-realistic time frame (72hrs). My partners and
												   I were successful!</p>
